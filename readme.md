# Big Data Analysis Project

## Abstract:
This project provides detailed information on how the Q-Learning algorithm can be optimized on multiple levels, using mountain car environment as am example. At first, we outline all essential information and challenges about Q-learning and mountain car environment, the algorithm's hyper-parameters will be optimized empirically using ML Flow. In a next step, Deep-Q algorithm will be introduced and optimized. Finally, the obtained results will be compared and an ideal way of optimization is suggested, which could be transferred to other Q-learning problems.
